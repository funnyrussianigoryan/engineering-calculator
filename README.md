# engineering-calculator
It is my first javascript native project. In this project i tryed to realized two types of calculator: simple and engineering. It is almost impossoble to enter invalid expression. For example, you can't to enter '00000..1', '1***/6'. But you may enter brackets in any order. This bug will be fixed in the future. Also I tryed to use MVC.
