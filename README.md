# engineering-calculator
It's my first javascript native project. In this project I tryed to realize two types of calculator: simple and engineering. It's almost impossoble to enter invalid expression. For example, you can't enter '00000..1', '1***/6'. But you may enter brackets in any order. This bug will be fixed in the future.
